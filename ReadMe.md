# Job Finder

This App will aide the user in their job search by providing direct links to company's career pages. 

## Phase 1

Gather links to companies career pages. Think about what the user would like to store and have access to. 

So far I thought of:

1. Store job title
2. Date applied
3. Verdict/Response
4. Location applied to
5. Job ID number
6. Screen shots of jobs applied to
7. Interactions with recruiters
8. Use Linkedin as a source to find people with the job title of recruiter
7. Separate out companies based on available locations
8. Allow filter for companies only in your area
9. Track new jobs that are post (webcrawlers?)

## Phase 2
1. Begin to work on the backend -- connecting a database and user authentication.
2. Create a form allowing the user to interact with the database.

## Phase 3
1. Use Advanced CSS techniques to create an appealing web page.
2. Configure web page to go live.
